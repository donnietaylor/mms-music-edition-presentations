### [terraform/](./terraform/) - Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Complete Terraform examples demonstrating the transformation from manual operations to Infrastructure as Code:

- **[installation/](./terraform/installation/)** - Local Terraform setup guides for different platforms
- **[simple-resources/](./terraform/simple-resources/)** - Basic resource deployments (Azure, AWS, multi-cloud)
- **[state-management/](./terraform/state-management/)** - Local and remote state configuration examples
- **[drift-detection/](./terraform/drift-detection/)** - Configuration drift scenarios and automated detection

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **New to Terraform?** Start with [terraform/installation/](./terraform/installation/) 
2. **Want hands-on examples?** Try [terraform/simple-resources/azure/](./terraform/simple-resources/azure/)
3. **Ready for teams?** Set up [terraform/state-management/remote-state/](./terraform/state-management/remote-state/)
4. **Need drift detection?** Explore [terraform/drift-detection/](./terraform/drift-detection/)

## üéØ ClickOps to DevOps Transformation

Each example demonstrates the journey from manual operations to automated DevOps workflows:

| Manual Approach (ClickOps) | Automated Approach (DevOps) |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Clicking through web portals | `terraform apply` |
| Inconsistent configurations | Reproducible infrastructure |
| Manual documentation | Self-documenting code |
| No change tracking | Full Git history |
| Drift goes unnoticed | Automated drift detection |

## üìö Additional Contents
