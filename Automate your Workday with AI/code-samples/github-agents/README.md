## Key Customization Techniques

1. **Custom Prompts**: Tailored instructions for specific domains and use cases
2. **Rule-Based Logic**: Configurable rules for decision making and automation
3. **Integration Patterns**: Connecting agents with external tools and services
4. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques to speed up agent execution
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms
6. **Monitoring & Observability**: Tracking agent performance and effectiveness

## Getting Started

1. Choose an example that matches your use case
2. Review the configuration files and customization options
3. Adapt the example to your specific requirements
4. Test the agent in a controlled environment
5. Deploy and monitor the customized agent

Each example includes detailed README files with setup instructions, customization guides, and best practices.
