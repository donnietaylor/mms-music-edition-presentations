        Hi John,
        
        Thanks for reaching out regarding database access for the Smith account analysis.
        
        To provide you with the appropriate access, I'll need:
        1. A brief description of the specific data you need
        2. Your manager's approval (as per our security policy)
        3. The expected duration of access
        
        Once I have these details, I can set up secure, audited access within 24 hours.
        
        Best regards,
        [Your Name]
        Database Administrator
