## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

Based on [GitHub's best practices guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/tutorials/coding-agent/get-the-best-results):

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed context and clear expectations
2. **Use Examples**: Include concrete examples of desired outputs
3. **Set Constraints**: Define boundaries and limitations clearly
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Test prompts and improve based on results
5. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes and performance metrics
