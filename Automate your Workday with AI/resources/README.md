### Best Practices for AI Agents

#### üéØ Agent Optimization Techniques
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, actionable prompts to your agents
- **Context Management**: Give agents relevant context about your codebase and requirements
- **Iterative Refinement**: Work with agents in small, focused steps rather than large changes
- **Error Handling**: Build robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track agent effectiveness and optimize based on results

#### üöÄ Speed & Efficiency Tips
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple agents for concurrent task execution
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement smart caching to avoid redundant operations
- **Selective Processing**: Only process changed files and dependencies
- **Template Reuse**: Create reusable templates for common automation patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar tasks for more efficient processing

#### üîß Customization Best Practices
- **Domain-Specific Prompts**: Tailor agent instructions to your specific industry or use case
- **Rule-Based Logic**: Implement configurable rules for consistent decision making
- **Integration Patterns**: Connect agents with your existing tools and workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Build in validation and testing for agent outputs
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for all customizations
